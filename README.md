RISC-V is a free and open ISA enabling a new era of processor innovation through open standard collaboration.

## Goals of the project
- Understand the RISC V ISA
- Port the project [FROM_BLINKER_TO_RISCV](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/learn-fpga/tree/master/FemtoRV/TUTORIALS/FROM_BLINKER_TO_RISCV) for the Artix 35T
- Implement the RISC32VE core and use make a flight controller for hex-rotror VTOLS
